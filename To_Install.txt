Welcome to "TO DO LIST" 

For setup: 
Using PostgreSQL(pgAdmin) create a DB called "MyToDoList"
Update user credentials in the backend file that connects to the database
    Location: ./BackEnd/index.py
    Line : 7
    replace : "admin" with own user credentials
    app.config['SQLALCHEMY_DATABASE_URI'] = 'postgresql://postgres:admin@localhost/MyToDoList'

using Docker-Compose:
run command : docker-compose up


To run applications in own terminal 
open each of the following folders in its own terminal:
        : BackEnd
        : FrontEnd

To start the back end service run command : 
    python index.py

To start the Front end service :
    change directory to 
        : todolist_frontend
    dir will look like :
        : FrontEnd/todolist_frontend
    run command :
        :pserve development.ini
        or 
        :pserve development.ini --reload


Thank you for the Learning opportunity, i have learned how to use Python pyramid and also SQLAlchemy, i learned a lot more on Docker
and believe with more time and even help i would be able to understand and know a lot more, also with Python pyramid and SQLAlchemy.

Thank you
